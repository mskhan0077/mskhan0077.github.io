I’m an MS student at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Bhopal](https://www.iiserb.ac.in/), pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I am currently a Graduate Researcher in the [Multi-Robot Autonomy (MOON) Lab](https://moonlab.iiserb.ac.in/), where my research focuses on the intersection of field robotics and multi-agent systems.

Over the past few years, I have worked extensively on marine robotics, designing and implementing autonomous systems capable of operating in challenging real-world environments. My projects span a wide range of applications — from autonomous surface vehicles for bathymetry mapping, collision avoidance of marine vehicles and water cleaning to bio-inspired robotic platforms and assistive wearable devices.

Looking ahead, I aspire to pursue a PhD and contribute to the development of intelligent field robotic systems that can operate autonomously in complex and dynamic environments. I am particularly interested in working at the intersection of academia and industry, bridging fundamental research with real-world applications to create impactful robotic solutions.
