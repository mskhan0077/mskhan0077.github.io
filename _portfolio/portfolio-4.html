We designed and developed an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) for marine research applications. 
The system integrates a flight controller, actuators, sensors, and an onboard computer to achieve fully autonomous operation. 
It also features multi-agent coordination capabilities, enabling collaborative missions among multiple ASVs for efficient and scalable marine exploration.
