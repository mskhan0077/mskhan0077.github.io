I participated in the ISRO Robotics Challenge – URSC 2024 (IRoC-U2024) as part of a 10-member team, where we designed and developed a custom 5-DOF manipulator arm for a pick-and-place task. 
The project involved using ,<a href="https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-python">Peter Corke’s Robotics Toolbox</a> for both simulation and real-world implementation, along with <a href="https://nvlabs.github.io/FoundationPose/">FoundationPose</a> for accurate object pose estimation and manipulation.
