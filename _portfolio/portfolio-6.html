We participated in the 2022–23 IEEE CASS Student Design Competition as part of a 6-member team, where we developed a device capable of capturing hand and finger movements using sensors and Arduino. 
The system integrated an Artificial Neural Network deployed on a Raspberry Pi to enable real-time translation of sign language gestures, demonstrating an innovative application of embedded systems and machine learning for assistive communication technology.
